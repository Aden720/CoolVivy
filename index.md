# Privacy Policy for CoolVivy

**Effective Date:** May 20, 2025

CoolVivy is designed with privacy in mind. We collect and store only the minimum data necessary to ensure the bot operates as intended.

## What Information We Collect

- **Server IDs (Guild IDs):** We store server IDs only for whitelist purposes. This allows the bot to restrict its functionality to approved servers.
- **Runtime Access:** The bot may temporarily access Discord user IDs or message content while processing commands, but this data is not stored or logged.

We do **not** collect or store:
- Usernames or Discord tags
- Message history
- Emails
- IP addresses
- Any personal data from users

## How We Use the Data

- **Server IDs** are used solely to control which servers are allowed to use extra features of the bot.
- No personal or user-specific data is stored or analyzed.

## OAuth2 Client Usage

When you authorize this bot using OAuth2, it uses only the permissions you grant. The client ID and secret are used strictly for authenticating with the Discord API. These credentials do not collect any user data.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** share any data with third parties. Your server ID is stored privately and securely.
